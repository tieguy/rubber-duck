# Bead: Future.co Integration

**Date:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** Parked (likely no API)

## Context

Future.co is a fitness coaching app used for exercise planning. Would be nice to pull workout details into the exercise nudge.

## Reality

Probably no public API. The exercise nudge will just be a reminder to open the app.

## If API Exists

- [ ] Research if Future.co has any API or export
- [ ] Check if there's calendar sync that could be used indirectly

## Current Approach

Just remind user to check the app. Keep it simple.
