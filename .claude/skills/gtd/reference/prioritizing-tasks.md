# Prioritizing Tasks

Algorithm for selecting TOP priorities in daily planning.

## Priority Order

1. **Overdue items** (highest priority)
   - Sort by days overdue (most overdue first)
   - These represent broken commitments

2. **Due today**
   - Hard deadlines that cannot slip
   - Time-specific items take precedence

3. **High-priority items due this week**
   - Todoist priority 1-3 (priority 4 is default/none)
   - Closer due date wins ties

4. **Strategic value** (tiebreaker)
   - Unblocks other work
   - High visibility/impact
   - User's stated current focus

## Constraints

- Select **2-4 items** only
- More than 4 dilutes focus and sets up for failure
- Fewer than 2 suggests either nothing is urgent (great!) or poor capture

## What NOT to Prioritize

- Tasks with no due date (unless strategically important)
- Someday-maybe items (by definition not for today)
- Waiting-for items (blocked on others)
- Tasks in "backburner" labeled projects
